#Interactive Quiz

![Quiz!](quiz.jpg)

In this assignment your goal is to work with a partner to create an interactive quiz that can help your classmates review a particular topic from one of your classes. The applications should present the user with information in the form of a combination of `Text`, `Media`, and `Image` classes. The user can then answer one multiple choice question at a time and be presented with score at the end. They should have the ability to retake the quiz without restarting the program.
 
Your application should include:

* Input controls (e.g. `RadioButton`, `CheckBox`, `ChoiceBox`)
* Media files (audio/video or both)
* At least five questions
* Methods to organize code
* Display the result (e.g. 3 out of 5)
* Transitions (fade, translate, rotate)
* Play a congratulatory sound of if all of the questions are answered correctly.

While writing the program, push your code to GitHub regularly. That way your partner can _Fetch_ and _Merge_ to work on the code together.
